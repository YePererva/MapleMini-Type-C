# Maple Mini (Type C)

[Work In Progress]

This repository contains my modification of STM32F103-based development board, widely known as [Maple Mini](https://www.leaflabs.com/maple/).

Originally, [Maple Mini](https://github.com/leaflabs/maplemini) was developed by [LeafLabs](https://www.leaflabs.com/) and was later modified by some third-party developer and sold under [Baite](https://stm32duinoforum.com/forum/viewtopic_f_38_t_2621.html) brand.

I wanted to introduce the USB type C connector and keep this schematic as example of minimal working infrastructure of STM32F103 microcontrollers for further hobbyist projects.

Here are schematics with added USB type C to both variations of boards.
